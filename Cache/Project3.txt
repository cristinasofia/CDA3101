The program will have three configuration parameters and a trace file specifier which will consist of a set of memory reference addresses(32-bits in size).

cache_sim <size of cache in bytes> <cache line size in bytes> <associativity> <file>

<cache size> is <= 64k bytes (and a power of 2)

<cache line size> is <= 128 bytes (and a power of 2)

<associativity> is >= 1

<file> contains one integer value per line representing an reference address

Output consists of:

Total number of memory references: <total>

Cache Hits: <total hits>

Cache Misses: <total misses>

Followed by a printout of the final cache contents.  Print the tag of each line in each set.  Lines in a set should be printed in the LRU positional order (MRU at the top, down to LRU at the bottom).  Sets should be displayed from set 0 down to the final set.
